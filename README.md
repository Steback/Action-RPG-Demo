# Action RPG Demo
I worked on this project for 6 months. I started with the focus of learning and practicing, so I learned many concepts about game development that will help me in future projects. Some of these concepts are animations, physics and how game engines work. I have the dream of creating a game engine and use it to create a game. Therefore, this project is a good start for a person with minimal knowledge about videogames and game engine development. This project caused me a lot of pain, because I'm a self-taught person, and I have learned all on videos, courses and books, this is a very slow process, but to me is worth it.

If you read my horrible code and want to tell me how I could be a better programmer, I will really appreciate it. Thank you.
